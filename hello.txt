My first assignment 1
[Project] Module 1
Topic:  Version Control using Git and GitHub: Commit, Branching, Merging, and Pull Requests

Steps:

1.Set Up a Local Git Repository:

o Initialize a new Git repository in your local development environment.
=> I will make a folder -> file in my local machine

o Create a new text file named README.md and add some initial project description or any content you choose.
=> I will make file on notepad and save it as "README.md"

o Stage and commit this file with an appropriate commit message.
=> git init (git will start. .git - a hidden file will be created)

2.Create a New GitHub Repository:
will write laterrrr

o Create a new repository on GitHub with a meaningful name.

o Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository (using git remote add).

o Push your local commits to the GitHub repository.

3.Branching:

o Create a new branch in your local repository called “dev”. 

o Switch to your new branch and create a new file called  hello.txt.

o Commit the changes to your new branch.

4.Pushing the New Branch:

o Push your new branch to GitHub, making sure it's reflected in your remote repository.

o Verify that your new branch is visible on GitHub.

5.Create a Pull Request:

o Once the new changes have been committed and pushed, go to your GitHub repository.

o Open a pull request to merge your new branch into the main branch.

o Provide a description of the changes you made in the pull request.

6.Merge the Pull Request:

o After reviewing your pull request, merge the pull request into the main branch on GitHub.

o Ensure that your local main branch is updated after the merge.

7.Submission Instructions:

o Once you have completed the above steps, ensure your GitHub repository is public.

o Share the link to your public GitHub repository where all the changes and pull requests can be viewed.

Deliverables:

 A public GitHub repository link containing:

oThe initial commit with the README.md file.

oA new branch with changes and a pull request created.

oThe pull request merged back into the main branch.

Important Notes:

 Your repository should be structured neatly with meaningful commit messages and proper branch names.

 Ensure that the pull request is descriptive, mentioning the changes made and the purpose of those changes.
